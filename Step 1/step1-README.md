# PURPOSE:

Detect how many paginated pages a listing has before crawling, so you can plan requests and avoid over/under-fetching.

# QUICK START:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
python generic_detect_pages.py "https://example.com/blog/"

# CHECKLIST (BEST PRACTICE):

## Legality & policy

- Read the site’s Terms of Service.

- Check robots.txt (e.g., https://example.com/robots.txt) for disallow rules and Crawl-delay. Respect them.

- If scraping is not allowed, don’t. If in doubt, ask for permission.

## Politeness

- Add small randomized delays between requests.

- Identify yourself in the UA if appropriate (e.g., “MyResearchBot/1.0 (+email)”); never impersonate a specific person.

- Implement retries with backoff on 429/5xx and slow down if you see rate limiting.

## Stability

- Set timeouts (connect + read).

- Save the first HTML locally when iterating on selectors.

- Log results (total_pages, detection method, evidence).

## Packages

- requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml (optional but recommended).

- For JS-heavy sites: Playwright (pip install playwright) or Selenium.

## Data hygiene

- Version‑control your parsing logic and record the date you validated it.

- Write tests for your selectors if this is productionized.

# FINDING THE RIGHT INFO:

1. View source / Inspect the first listing page. 
2. Search for:

    - a pagination block (.pagination, .page-numbers, nav[aria-label*="pagination"]),

    - `<a rel="next">, <a rel="last"> or <link rel="last"> in the <head>.`

3. Hover pagination links to see URL patterns:

    - ?page=2
    - ?p=2
    - /page/2/ 
    - /page:2/ 
    - ?offset=20

4. Look for visible text like “Page 1 of 23”.

5. If it’s infinite scroll:
    - Open DevTools → Network → XHR/Fetch 
    - Scroll down and capture the JSON endpoint the page calls.
    - Look for page, offset, or a cursor token in requests.
    
    - In that case:

        - There may be no fixed “total pages”. You’ll iterate until the endpoint returns no results.

5. Internationalization: pagination text may be localized (German “Seite … von …”, etc.). Adjust patterns if needed.

# USING THE GENERALISED SCRIPT IN A PIPELINE:

Run it once per listing type to obtain total_pages.

If method is default, treat total_pages=1 as a conservative guess and consider a secondary strategy (e.g., attempt page 2 and see if it 404s).

If method is numbered-links or rel=last, you can confidently crawl pages 1..N.

## Advantages of the generalised approach:

- Works out‑of‑the‑box on many CMSes without per‑site code.

- Tells you how it decided (transparency).

- Retries + timeouts + session reuse are production-friendly.

## Disadvantages / trade-offs:

- Heuristics: might be wrong on unusual markup (e.g., numbers in unrelated links).

- Doesn’t solve JS‑rendered or cursor‑based pagination.

- Multilingual text detection is basic (extend patterns as needed).

- Very defensive logic can still miss bespoke widgets.

## Specific use cases where it's a good fit:

- Blog archives, category listings, e‑commerce category pages with traditional pagination.

- News sites with classic page numbers.

- Directory/listing sites where page numbers are part of URLs.

## When to use a different tool:

- Single Page Apps / infinite scroll → Playwright/Selenium or direct JSON API calls.

- Cursor pagination → iterate API until empty, don’t try to count pages.

- Sites with strong anti‑bot measures → reconsider, seek permission, or integrate polite rate limiting and caching.
